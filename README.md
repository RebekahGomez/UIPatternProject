# API Practice
- This project demonstrates use with an API & a Slider pattern
- Link to the API here https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ 
### Requirements:
- Pick a UI pattern from a given list and an API. You'll then build out the UI pattern you chose to work with the API you chose.
- The user should see the content on the screen with 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons. When they click on the 'Next' button, the slider should shift to show the next item in the list. When the user clicks on the 'Previous' button, the slider should shift to show the previous items in the list. If there is no next or previous items, the slider could loop to the other end of the list or prevent the user from clicking those buttons.
